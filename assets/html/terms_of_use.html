            If you do not agree to the Terms of Use, please do not use our site. We reserve the right, at our
            discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Use at any time. Your continued use

        <h2>Use License</h2>
        <p>Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on our
            website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer
            of title, and under this license you may not:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);
            </li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on our website;</li>
            <li>remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or</li>
            <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by
            us at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license,
            you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format. </p>
